# Start Coding Challenges

This project provides a collection of JavasScript or TypeScript challenges to test your knowledge.

To start, you can run the following command:

```
$ npx start-coding-challenge
```

This command will provide you with a few questions to name your project folder, and whether you want to complete the challenges in JavaScript or TypeScript.

When the setup is complete, follow the instructions inside the terminal to start coding.

## How to use

While working on the challenges, you're able to run the built-in test runner to check if your code is correct.
Run `npm test` to run all tests in the project, or run `npm test <test-name>` to run a specific test.

For example, while working on the `add` challenge, you can run `npm test add` to only tun the tests for that challenge. You'll know that your code is correct if the tests pass.
