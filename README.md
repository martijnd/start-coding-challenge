# Start Coding Challenges

This project provides a collection of JavasScript or TypeScript challenges to test your knowledge.

To start, you can run the following command: `npx start-coding-challenge` and follow the instructions.

## How to use

While working on the challenges, you're able to run the built-in test runner to check if your code is correct.
Run `npm test` to run all tests in the project, or run `npm test <test-name>` to run a specific test.

For example, while working on the `add` challenge, you can run `npm test add` to only tun the tests for that challenge. You'll know that your code is correct if the tests pass.
